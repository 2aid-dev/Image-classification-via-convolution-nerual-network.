# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Description
This project aims to classify images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It involves data preparation, model design, training, evaluation, and optimization strategies.

### Experiment Overview
- Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess labeled image datasets.
- Model Design: Select CNN architecture and configure layers.
- Training the Model: Define loss function, optimizer, and data augmentation techniques.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate performance metrics on test datasets.
- Optimization Strategies: Fine-tune model parameters, use transfer learning, and monitor performance.

## Optimization Strategies
1. **Improving Training Data**
   - Data Augmentation: Apply transformations to increase dataset variability.
   - Test Data Transformations: Apply appropriate transformations to test data.

2. **Improving Model Architecture**
   - Use a More Complex Model: Experiment with models like ResNet50.
   
3. **Improving the Loss Function and Optimizer**
   - Enhance the Loss Function: Try different loss functions.
   - Enhance the Optimizer: Experiment with optimizers like Adam.
   
4. **Training Optimization Techniques**
